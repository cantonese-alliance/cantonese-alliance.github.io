              <h4>Historical Background</h4>
              <p>
                Most of the early Chinese immigrants to the U.S. came from
                Gwongdung (Guangdong) Province during the Gold Rush, most
                notably from a coastal county known as 新寧 (modern-day
                Taishan). Many of them settled in San Francisco and formed a
                community known as 唐人街 (Tang People Street) in Cantonese and
                Chinatown in English. By 1960s, Taishanese still made up over
                60% of the Chinese immigrant population in the U.S. An example
                of a famous Cantonese American of Taishanese descent is former
                ambassador to China Gary Locke.

              <h4>Who is a CHL learner?</h4>
              <p>
                Bases on Valdez' definition, a CHL learner "is raised in a home"
                where Cantonese is spoken. The learner can speak or understand
                Cantonese to a certain extent.

              <h4>What are the characteristics of CHL?</h4>
              <h5>General Trends are identified in CHL:</h5>
              <p>
                My colleagues and I have found general trends when we focus on
                CHL learners who are the second generation of Cantonese
                immigrants (Dennig &amp; Leung, 2012a, 2012b; Dennig, Leung,
                &amp; Uchikoshi, 2011):
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Culture: Familiarity with Cantonese culture</li>
                <li>Pronunciation: Near-native to Native.</li>
                <li>
                  Syntax: Basic Cantonese grammar is acquired. CHL learners'
                  production of grammatical categories such as NP, aspect
                  markers, and discourse connectors mirror the controls' to a
                  large extent. For example, the distinctive NP type,
                  [CLASSIFIER  NOUN], which interacts with word order to derive
                  its definiteness, is the most frequent from produced by CHL
                  speakers and controls alike.  Major word-order errors commonly
                  found in Cantonese as a foreign language, e.g. placing PP
                  after the main verb, is not common in this subgroup of CHL
                  learners. Re-analyses may occur when English becomes dominant,
                  most notably, the order of the direct and indirect objects
                  with dative verbs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Semantics: Novel forms may involve restructuring of contrasts
                  consistent with semantic primaries. For example, in producing
                  noun classifiers while performing a cognitively demanding
                  task, CHL speakers may rely on the primary distinction
                  between small (one or two) vs. large or undefinited
                  quantities, using
                  <i>di</i>
                  correctly for the latter and overextending
                  <i>go</i>
                  for the former though they know the correct classifiers when
                  they are asked directly to provide the classifiers for
                  specific nouns.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Syntax-Semantics Interface: Novel structures involve
                  hybridization of Cantonese verbs and English syntactic
                  structures, e.g. inserting the verb for shouting
                  <i>giu</i>
                  into a directional PP: *
                  <span>giu yahp go lūng</span>
                  <span> "shout into a hole."</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Discourse: Discourse structures, e.g. narratives, can be
                  learned in English at school and transferred to Cantonese. The
                  CHL learners' acquisition of discourse functions, e.g.
                  referential functions, is comparable to monolingual children's
                  acquisition across diverse languages.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Syntax-discourse Interface: Certain forms may be underused,
                  e.g. bare nouns largely disappeared in lower elementary grades
                  after English became dominant and re-appeared again later on.
                  The under use is not ungrammatical but differs from the
                  controls' pattern of usage.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Variability is a fundamental part of CHL learning:</h5>
              <p>
                Variability is fact part of any form of language learning.
                Research on L1 acquisition by monolingual children has
                increasingly found individual differences, not just in the
                acquisition of vocabulary and complex structures, but also in
                basic grammatical structures (Dąbrowska, 2013). Variability is
                to be expected in CHL learning as CHL learners are more
                influenced than their monolingual peers by a synergy of social
                factors, e.g. availability of Cantonese in their school systems,
                societal attitude towards Cantonese, and the social context in
                which they use Cantonese. The social factors combined with their
                personal experience with speaking Cantonese help shape their
                cultural identity, which influences how motivated they are about
                maintaining their HL.

                  "Members of minority groups are not simple inheritors of fixed
                  identities, ethnicities, cultures, and languages but are
                  instead engaged in a continual collective and individual
                  process of making, remaking, and negotiating these elements,

                  Variability stems from the ongoing self-organization of
                  systems of activity. To honor this, we need to take into
                  account learners' histories, orientations and intentions,
                  thoughts and feelings. We need to consider the tasks that
                  learners perform and to consider each performance anew -
                  stable and predictable in part, but at the same time,
                  variable, flexible, and dynamically adapted to fit the
                  changing situation. Learners actively transform their
                  linguistic world; they do not just conform to it"
                  (Larsen-Freeman, 2010, p. 53).

                About three-quarters of the adult CHL learners in our research
                project were administered ACTFL's Oral Proficiency Interview and
                their proficiency levels ranged from intermediate-low to
                advanced-mid, which is consistent with my observation about the
                CHL learners in my Cantonese program. Being able to reach these
                levels is impressive. According to a report published in 2010 by
                the Center for Applied Second Language Studies (CASLS) at the
                University of Oregon, only a small percentage of FL students can
                reach the intermediate-mid level after four years of learning a
                FL: "Of course, the number of hours needed to reach a specific
                proficiency level varies from student to student, but our
                research shows that only about 15% of students reach a
                proficiency level near Intermediate-Mid even after approximately
                720 hours of study, which is about four years in a typical high
                school program" (CASLS, 2010, p.1).

                HL learners are indeed valuable human resources to this and
                other countries: "We desperately need competence in languages-to
                become "a language-competent society," in Tucker's phrase
                (1991)-and our huge and varied heritage language resources have
                a definite role to play in achieving such competence" (Fishman,
                2001, p. 95).
